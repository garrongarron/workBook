# Project management

You probably want to create the game that you are proud of and that will change your life forever. This is perfect, because not everyone has the same enthusiasm as you. What is not compatible with that perfect dream is to believe that you can do it in a few hours or days and with little effort.

If you work alone, you probably don't mind creating your game in a few hours or in two or three years, but if you work as a team, you should surely have a clear objective, a deadline to complete it, and many tasks to complete.

In a general sense, **project management** means applying a process or methodology to accomplish a task within a given time frame with a defined objective. It can be anything from creating a website to planning a wedding. The fact that a project has a certain deadline is what differentiates project management from daily management.

## Timing is everything

As we already know, a video game must entertain, the objective is clear, and for this we must make a software and deploy it on a platform. Regarding time, the best thing you can do is propose a deadline and make decisions according to that deadline. The best advice I can give you is not to start if you do not have a deadline, otherwise you will perform tasks that are not convenient.

All tasks can be important from some point of view. But not all tasks have the same priority. Therefore, you should discard the non-priority tasks and modify the priority tasks based on your available time.

**The more time you have, the more tasks you can do**.

On the other hand, if you have time, you can perform the task with a high level of detail, but if you don't have time, you would only do the minimum necessary to fulfill what is required.
this last example is the one that should interest us because it shows what are the minimum and mandatory tasks to fulfill the objective, which in our case is to make a video game.

In this book we will do the minimum to understand what are the tasks that we must discard when we develop video games and mention what are the important tasks.

## Ideas have no value
Many will say that everything begins with an idea, which is true, but it is the same as saying that we live because we breathe.
Ideas and air are free. But to live we need food and shelter that cannot be obtained with air.
To create a video game we need to generate images on the screen and listen to keyboard events. The color of a pixel does not come from an idea, nor do you upload an idea to a video game platform.
The next time someone tells you they have an idea, ask them how long they think it will take to develop the game and what the costs and benefits will be, including your hourly wage, not forgetting to mention that an annual contract is 2,000 hours.
