# Graphic design

As we have been talking about, a video game is made up of inputs and outputs. As the name suggests, the outputs of a video game are visual, so talking about graphic design is quite accurate.
Sadly, graphic design is not naive and innocent. It is quite the opposite, graphic design is intentional, it contains a purpose and most of the time that purpose is hidden. In video game development the intention is to entertain. And one of the tools to achieve this is graphic design.
Graphic design is not the end result, it is not what you see, graphic design is the intention of giving a message with a specific purpose. It is no coincidence that the mouse pointer has a hand with the index finger extended or an arrow as an icon instead of a cup. It is also not by chance that a character is in the center of the screen, or that he turns his back on us. If there is an intention behind an image or part of an image, there is a design or plan that has been developed to convey a specific message with a particular purpose.
When you do not have experience, you think that it is about deciding without criteria where to place and distribute the visual elements or what colors to choose, what sizes to have. But it is a battle between the different images that fight to get your attention. That is why we feel more comfortable with fewer elements and with more simplicity. We don't have to go to the trouble of ignoring annoying and unpleasant messages, we simply pursue a single message with a simple purpose.
