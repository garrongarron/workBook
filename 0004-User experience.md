The main purpose of a video game is to entertain. And you will know that you are doing a good job if the player is entertained. But how will you know? **How will you know that your game is entertaining?** Basically measuring the time the player plays. But thinking this way is not enough. Because a video game can also be short. The popular saying goes that *If something is good and it is also short, it is twice as good*. So what has to happen while the player is playing?
The answer is **to have a good experience while the player is playing**.

It all starts with the first contact with the game, even without being able to play it, when the potential player sees an image, a news or a comment about the game. Later, when the potential player decides to buy the game to test it, they may have difficulties to acquire it, the same must be thought when you install the game, when you see the first screen, when you want to see the instructions. . When you play, when you want to turn off the game, when you want to play again.

All these aspects must be taken into account when developing a video game. **Because it is a product that will touch people's lives in many ways**. We have to take into account every interaction between our product and the customer, that is, between the game and the player.
