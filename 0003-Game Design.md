# Game Design

As much as we have an infinite loop, a renderer, and a system that detects inputs, this is still not a video game. To create a video game we need to entertain and interact with it. It's not difficult to make something happen on the screen when a key is pressed, but making it fun is a skill that needs to be developed. Those who are in charge of entertaining with the interaction are the **game designers**. If a game is boring it is not because the code is badly made or because the art is ugly. It's simply because the **game designer** didn't do his job well. The game designer must mainly entertain based on experience, psychological knowledge, narrative, visual or auditory resources, and as far as possible with player interaction, otherwise we would be watching or creating a movie. It seems like a very big responsibility for a single person. And it actually is. But what large companies usually do is have **game designers** specialized in different disciplines. From there come narrative designers, level designers, combat designers, economy designers, and others. But at the end of the day the only thing that is sought is to entertain the player. Does not matter how. But if you stayed focused, you will know that it is simply about doing something with the inputs in order to generate something on the screen aiming to entertain th eplayer. It sounds simple, but it is difficult.
