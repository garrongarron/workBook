# Deployment

When we click on the icon of our game, on our computer or smartphone, or when we put the DVD or select our game on a console, we are accessing a final product that is the result of many creative activities. The difference between a game that exists and another that does not exist is the deployment or production exit.

If it's a mobile game, you can probably get it from the Google Play store or the Apple store. If it's in a computer game, you'll probably get it on Steam. And if a game is console, you will probably get it in the official stores of those consoles. Getting your game on one of these platforms is an activity called deployment and consists of many steps and in most cases it is not free. You will have to create the software and then introduce it in one of these platforms.
