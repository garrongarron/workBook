# Programing

Before we start talking about zeros and ones we have to have the elements that we are going to use ready. The first element is this same course, and the second is explained in the next section.

## Tools ##

As in any serious course, it will be necessary to have teaching tools that support educational activities to reinforce the learning experience. In our case, it will be free software available for all operating systems. With this tool we can create our first games on a web page. That software is **Visual Studio Code**. It would not be good to waste time explaining step by step how to install the software knowing that it is really easy to do it and that there are many tutorials on the internet that explain it to you or even knowing that you probably already have it installed. But it is no exaggeration to say that it should not be confused with other similarly named software. **Visual Studio** is not the same as **Visual Studio Code**. You have to install **Visual Studio Code**.

## Electronic devices ##

Even if you have not thought about it, when you talk about video games you are referring to an electronic device with **software** that manages input events such as keyboard, mouse, or gamepad and generates visual and sound stimuli through a screen and a speakers. But, expressed in this way it doesn't sound so funny. However, thinking about it this way is useful to be aware of what you are creating, producing or selling. A video game is **software**. Because creating a video game is creating software, we have to understand how to create software. A software is a set of **instructions** that are **executed** with a purpose. The way to organize the instructions is called the **algorithm**.

## Algorithms in video games ##

The same algorithm can be explained in a simple and complex way. A simple way to explain an algorithm would be "If you press this button the player jumps". A complex way to explain the same algorithm would be "When the main loop of the software executes the validation of the mouse events and verifies that the state of the same change must be called the procedure that triggers a physical process that is going to be represented in the system of rendering of images in a series of frames per second generating an illusion of movement that allows the user to experience the sensation of controlling a character". Next we are going to list and explain in a general way the most common video game programming algorithms.


**The following algorithms are the algorithms of any video game.**

* **Infinite Loop:** It is an algorithm that is responsible for repeating the same instructions over and over again. It is used to render many images per second to generate an illusion of movement on the video game screen.
* **Renderer:** It is an algorithm that is responsible for reading the information available to generate a simple image. The end result is a number of pixels with different colors that can be seen on the screen.
* **Input controller:** It is an algorithm that detects when an input device generates an event to convert it into useful information for the interaction between the game and the human player. For example, clicking, touching the screen, moving the mouse, pressing a key or moving the joystick, or rotating the cell phone or virtual reality glasses.

As you can see, these three algorithms represent the *inputs* (input controller), the *outputs* (renderer), and the *entertainment* with time segmentation (infinite loop). Since the purpose of a video game is to entertain.
